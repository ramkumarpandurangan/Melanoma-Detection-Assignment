# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection using CNN
> Melanoma skin cancer detection involves the identification and classification of melanoma, a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. Melanoma is known for its potential to metastasize and become life-threatening if not detected and treated early


## Table of Contents
* Melanoma skin cancer detection involves the identification and classification of melanoma, a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. Melanoma is known for its potential to metastasize and become life-threatening if not detected and treated early 
* Technologies Used - Python, Jupyter, Anaconda, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Git, Seaborn, CNN, Tenserflow, Keras
* Early detection of melanoma is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, manual detection methods rely heavily on the expertise of dermatologists and can be subjective. By leveraging machine learning models trained on large datasets of skin lesion images, we can develop an automated system that assists dermatologists in the early detection and classification of melanoma lesions.

## General Information
-Import the data and convert the data which is in images to a dataset type which can be then used to train the model.

-Create, Compile and Train the model for train and validation dataset and then evaluate the model for accuracy.

-Use appropriate Loss function, Optimizers and metrics. Use techniques such as normalization, reguralization is needed.

Main Background of the Project is to develop a system for the early detection and classification of melanoma skin cancer using machine learning techniques. We are using train and test dataset() provided by upgrad to do the same but the same is available to use from Kaggle as well.

## Conclusions
- We were able to reshape the data if necessary.
- We were able to Visualise the data to uncover patters and insights.
- We were able to prepare the data as best as possible to make the model predictions as efficient and accurate as possible.
- We were able to build a CNN model with different layers.
- We were able to accuratly predict the class given an image as input.
